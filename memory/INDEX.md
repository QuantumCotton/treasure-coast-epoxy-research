- **Today's work:** Read [memory/2026-01-28.md](memory/2026-01-28.md)
- **How to restart:** [MEMORY.md](MEMORY.md) → "Gateway Management" section
- **VPS connection:** [MEMORY.md](MEMORY.md) → "Quick Reference" or [testing-plan-workflow.md](memory/testing-plan-workflow.md)
- **Agent commands:** [MEMORY.md](MEMORY.md) → "Agent Capabilities" or [2025-01-27.md](memory/2025-01-27.md)
- **Testing strategy:** [testing-plan-workflow.md](memory/testing-plan-workflow.md)
- **How agents work:** [agent-spawn-behavior.md](memory/agent-spawn-behavior.md)

## File Relationships

```
MEMORY.md (main knowledge base)
    ├─ Quick Reference (commands, environment)
    ├─ Gateway Management (restart, config)
    ├─ Agent Strategy (when to spawn, how to use)
    ├─ Testing Workflow (current phase)
    ├─ Memory Organization (how files work)
    ├─ Important Notes (safety, boundaries)
    └─ CLI Commands (tool reference)

memory/INDEX.md (this file)
    └─ Quick navigation to all files

memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (daily logs)
    └─ Raw session notes, updated as we work

memory/topic-name.md (topic files)
    └─ Deep dives into specific topics
```

## Search Tips

### When I'm "stuck" or need context:
1. **Start with:** `MEMORY.md` - has most important info
2. **If recent:** Check today's `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. **If specific topic:** Use this INDEX to find the right file
4. **If searching:** Use `memory_search` with specific keywords

### Good search terms:
- "restart command" → leads to gateway config
- "VPS" or "VNC" → leads to connection info
- "spawn agent" → leads to agent strategy
- "testing" → leads to testing workflow
- "product" or "agnostic" → leads to unbiased strategy

---

## Key Dates & Milestones

- **2025-01-27:** Documented agent capabilities, setup testing plan
- **2026-01-28:** Enabled `/restart` command, created MEMORY.md and INDEX.md
- **Current Phase:** Testing dual-agent setup (zai + OpenAI)
- **Next Phase:** Full environment restart + new project

## Maintenance Notes

### How to update this index:
- Add new daily files as they're created
- Add new topic files when created
- Update key dates as milestones pass
- Keep relationships diagram accurate

### When to create new topic files:
- When a subject becomes complex enough to need its own file
- When multiple sessions reference the same concept
- When you want deep documentation of a specific workflow or strategy

### How to organize memory:
1. **Daily files:** Raw logs of what happened each day
2. **Topic files:** Deep dives into important subjects
3. **MEMORY.md:** Curated essence from everything
4. **INDEX.md:** Navigation guide to all files
