## Section 1: Flake Material Types

### 1.1 Solid Color Flakes (Vinyl Acrylic)

Solid color flakes, also known as vinyl acrylic flakes or polymer flakes, are the most widely used decorative medium in epoxy flooring. These flakes are produced from acrylic or vinyl polymer resins, cut into specific sizes, and pigmented to achieve consistent coloration.

**Composition & Manufacturing:**
- Base materials: Acrylic copolymer, vinyl chloride-acetate copolymer, or polyethylene
- Additives: UV stabilizers, impact modifiers, and colorfast pigments
- Manufacturing process: Extruded sheets → precision cutting → screening → bagging

**Flake Size Classifications:**

| Flake Designation | Dimensions (inches) | Typical Applications |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Micro Flakes | 1/128" - 1/64" | Residential garages, patios |
| Mini Flakes | 1/64" - 1/32" | Showrooms, residential basements |
| Standard Flakes | 1/32" - 1/16" | **Most common** - garages, commercial spaces |
| Large Flakes | 1/16" - 1/8" | Industrial floors, high-traffic retail |
| Mega Flakes | 1/8" - 1/4" | Accent areas, specialty installations |

**Color Systems:**
Solid flakes are available in hundreds of standard colors and can be custom-matched. Major suppliers organize color collections by:
- Single colors (solid, uniform flakes)
- Two-color blends (50/50, 75/25 ratios)
- Multi-color blends (3-5 colors for depth and visual interest)

Popular Florida-suited color palettes include:
- **Coastal neutrals:** Sand, beige, tan, light gray
- **Tropical tones:** Aqua, coral, teal, seafoam
- **Industrial grays:** Charcoal, slate, silver, gunmetal
- **Earthy tones:** Brown, terra cotta, rust, olive

**Performance Characteristics:**
- UV resistance: Good to excellent (with proper stabilizers)
- Chemical resistance: Excellent to most solvents, oils, and mild acids
- Temperature tolerance: -60°F to +180°F standard formulation
- Impact resistance: High (flexible polymer construction)
- Moisture resistance: Excellent (non-porous)

**Installation Considerations:**
- Broadcast rate: 100-150 square feet per pound (standard flakes, 1/32" coverage)
- Topcoat thickness: 10-15 mils required for proper encapsulation
- Compatibility: Works with 100% solids epoxy, waterborne epoxy, and polyurethane topcoats

### 1.2 Metallic Flakes

Metallic flakes create distinctive, shimmering surfaces that simulate the appearance of polished metal surfaces or create artistic, multi-dimensional visual effects. These flakes contain actual metallic particles or mica coated with metallic oxides.

**Composition Types:**

- **ASTM F1677:** Brungraber Mark II (DCOF - Dynamic COF)
- **ASTM C1028:** Pendulum tester (more common internationally)

**Slip Resistance by Surface Type:**

| Surface | Dry COF | Wet COF | Recommended Application |
|---------|---------|---------|------------------------|
| Smooth epoxy (no flakes) | 0.65-0.75 | 0.35-0.45 | Not recommended |
| Fine flake broadcast | 0.70-0.80 | 0.45-0.55 | Light traffic |
| Standard flake broadcast | 0.75-0.85 | 0.50-0.60 | General use (most common) |
| Heavy flake broadcast | 0.80-0.90 | 0.55-0.65 | High traffic |
| Flake + aggregate | 0.85-0.95 | 0.60-0.70 | Wet environments |

**Flake Size vs. Slip Resistance:**

| Flake Size | Texture | Slip Resistance | Maintenance |
|------------|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| Micro (1/128"-1/64") | Fine | 0.50-0.60 wet | Easy to clean |
| Mini (1/64"-1/32") | Fine-medium | 0.55-0.65 wet | Easy to clean |
| Standard (1/32"-1/16") | Medium | 0.60-0.70 wet | Standard cleaning |
| Large (1/16"-1/8") | Medium-coarse | 0.65-0.75 wet | More aggressive cleaning |
| Mega (1/8"-1/4") | Coarse | 0.70-0.80 wet | Difficult cleaning |

**Enhancing Slip Resistance:**

1. **Increased flake density:** More flakes = more texture
2. **Mixed-size flakes:** Creates natural texture variation
3. **Aggregate addition:** Aluminum oxide, silica sand mixed with flakes
4. **Grit additives:** Anti-slip additives in topcoat
5. **Surface profiling:** Broadcast excess, then lightly grind

**Trade-offs:**
- **Higher slip resistance = More difficult cleaning**
- **Coarser texture = More visible dirt**
- **Balance needed** for each application

**Application-Specific Recommendations:**

| Application | Target COF (wet) | Flake Strategy | Topcoat |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| Residential garage | ≥0.50 | Standard flake, full broadcast | Polyurethane |
| Kitchen | ≥0.55 | Standard + texture additive | Aliphatic polyurethane |
